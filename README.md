# Quantum-Fractal Analysis System

A sophisticated quantum-fractal analysis system developed by The Emergence Collective, implementing the Fractal Resonance Framework (FRF). This system unifies quantum computing with fractal analysis for mathematical theory exploration.

## Features

- Fractal resonance analysis of mathematical theories
- Quantum circuit simulation with error mitigation
- Cross-validation between quantum and fractal results
- Real-time visualization and result tracking
- Support for both IBM Quantum hardware and Aer simulator

## Components

- Core quantum-fractal analysis system
- Interactive data visualization
- Problem database with mathematical theories
- Quantum-fractal comparison engine

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- scikit-learn
- IBM Qiskit (optional)

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n quantum-fractal python=3.9
conda activate quantum-fractal
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```
